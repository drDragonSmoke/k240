Here are a few bugs which appear in the game. Some bugs were fixed between the
game's original v1.886 release and the later v2.000 release.

### Alien scaffold bug

Clicking on an alien scaffold while in "flat" building mode sometimes causes
junk to appear on screen instead of a building name.

### Yards need more Bytanium

The Orbital Space Dock appears to incorrectly judge the amount of ore necessary
to build a ship. It reports an ore shortage if there is less in store than the
total amount needed to build the ship. However, ore is used gradually as the
ship is built, meaning that you may still have enough ore left to finish the
ship.

### Photon or Plasma?

The game is inconsistent as to whether photon or plasma is the most powerful.

### Minor typos

In the missile build screen, "AREA EXPLOSIVE." has a full stop at the end of its
name, but no other missile does.

The game consistently misspells _hangar_ as _hanger_.
