Here are a few bugs which appear in the game. Some bugs were fixed between the
game's original v1.886 release and the later v2.000 release.

### Alien scaffold bug

Clicking on an alien scaffold while in "flat" building mode sometimes causes
junk to appear on screen instead of a building name.

### Yards need more Bytanium

The Orbital Space Dock appears to incorrectly judge the amount of ore necessary
to build a ship. It reports an ore shortage if there is less in store than the
total amount needed to build the ship. However, ore is used gradually as the
ship is built, meaning that you may still have enough ore left to finish the
ship.

### Photon or Plasma?

The game is inconsistent as to whether photon or plasma is the most powerful. In
turret buildings, Photon is described as superior to Plasma, and the game code
confirms this (Photon deals 8 damage, Plasma 5 damage, and Laser 2 damage).

However, with ship hardpoints, Plasma (9000 CR) costs more than Photon (4500
CR) and is described in the manual as superior. The game code confirms that this
is a mistake: Photon Cannon, despite being cheaper, is more powerful. The ship
cannons deal exactly the same damage as their turret counterparts.

### Wrong blueprint

The blueprints of the Static Inducer and Warp Generator don't match their
appearance in in the build window.

In the Sci-Tek screen, the cross-shaped hardpoint is the Static Inducer, while
the more cannon-shaped item is the Warp Generator. Note the Warp Generator's
reference to "cloak sequencer" in the graphic. In the Construction Yard screen,
they are swapped.

### Minor typos

In the missile build screen, "AREA EXPLOSIVE." has a full stop at the end of its
name, but no other missile does.

The game consistently misspells _hangar_ as _hanger_.
