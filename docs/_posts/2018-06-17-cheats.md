### Cheat codes

A set of 12 cheat codes appears in the game code.

To enter a cheat, type it on the keyboard (not case sensitive), hitting the
Return key before and after the code. You can chain together multiple codes this
way. You will hear a beep if a code has been entered correctly.

Bjork
: Voice test. Hit A-U to test one of the 21 voice samples. There is a bug: it
doesn't validate for keys below A, so you get interesting results pressing a
number key: if you press 1, it may ask for disk &Sigma;. Press space to exit.

ICBM
: Give 4 of each missile and 4 spy satellites to the currently selected
asteroid, whether it belongs to you, an alien, or nobody. Limited to 4 because
aliens are capped to 5 of each missile, so this way it's safe even if the alien
builds one right after you hit the cheat. Of course, aliens can't use spy
satellites as they have no satellite silo, and Tylarans have no missile silos.
If you ICBM an empty asteroid, the missiles will still be there when you
colonize it later.

Iceman
: Freezes all asteroid movement. Use again to restore movement again.

Lemings
: Add 50 population to the current asteroid, regardless of who owns it.  Note
that the cheat code is deliberately  spelled with one M like this. The cheat
code entry method ignores multiples of a letter, so typing _lemmings_
or even _lemmmmminnnnggss_ will work fine.

Loadsadosh
: Give 100,000 credits. Around 0x1a7fa in the game executable _playk240_
(v1.886) you will see the number _000186a0_. Hex edit that to
_000f4240_. Now it will instead give 1 million. The cap is 9,999,999
(one less than 10 million).

NASA
: Create a ship at the current location. It has random hardpoints, like a ship
acquired via reinforcements. Such a ship will always have a weapon in its first
hardpoint to ensure it doesn't accidentally generate an unarmed ship, even
though you may sometimes want a shields-only build for a scoutship or
transporter. It will also never generate a ship with a Static Inducer or Warp
Generator.

Noises
: Sound test. Press A-W to test one of the in-game noises. Unlike the Bjork
cheat, this correctly validates its inputs.

Panel
: Extracts a useful set of buttons. The buttons don't show until the screen is
refreshed, but the easiest way to do this is to tap the left and right cursor
keys to rotate the asteroid and back.

Skyscraper
: The build time of all Terran buildings is reduced to one day. Doesn't affect
buildings already under construction.

Telescope
: You can see all asteroids on the field view without scouting for them first,
and view all asteroids without a spy satellite. However, in all other ways,
undiscovered asteroids still count as undiscovered. Missiles you fire at them
will disappear (peculiarly, the Tylarans are exempt from this). Scout ships will
still earn rewards for discovering asteroids.

Tracey
: Toggle voice on/off. Named after Tracey Park, who provides the voice samples.

Widget
: Toggle which blueprints you own. This is a bother because even though you gain
every blueprint you didn't already have, you lose every blueprint you already
had, and they're usually good ones so you have to buy them back. Clicking on the
Sci-Tek button when you own every blueprint does nothing.

Certain cheat disks and sources list only Loadsadosh, Widget, Iceman and
Skyscraper, apparently unaware of the other eight cheats. I suspect this
occurred because some Amiga magazine once printed only the four most useful
cheats to save space. It may also be that the effect of some cheats were not
obvious.

### Tricks

__Glimpse enemy asteroids__: Set a hotkey to an enemy asteroid. Go to colony
view of one of your own asteroids, or an empty asteroid. Now hit the hotkey.
You'll get an error message, but for a second the game will let you see the
enemy colony.

__Faster scout report__: A scout ship gives its report when it returns to the
asteroid it set out from, but that doesn't have to be one of your colonies. You
can speed up scout reports by sending the scout to a closer unoccupied asteroid,
then scouting from there. You will get the report when it returns to the
unoccupied asteroid it set out from.

Even better, if you do an ore survey at that asteroid, you will get it
immediately. In other words, send the scout ship first, then when it arrives,
order it to do the survey. It will "return" to the surveyed asteroid and give
you the report immediately.

__Other minor features__: See [bugs](../game-mechanics/bugs.html) and
[miscellaneous features](../game-mechanics/miscellaneous-features.html)
for a few other quirks of the game. Notably, the Photon Cannon ship hardpoint is
more powerful than the more expensive Plasma; and you can hold the left mouse
button to skip the intro sequence.

### Falsely claimed secret alien cheat

It is popularly claimed that if you attempt to load a save game from slot 1 with
Disk 2 in the drive, you will be rewarded with an extra hard opponent. This is
false.

There are no save games on disk 2. It's impossible to save to disk 2, because it
has only 15KB free, whereas K240 save games are about 150KB each. There is no
additional alien file, no code in the game relating to a secret seventh alien,
and the cheat does not actually function as described in any version. There is
also not enough space on disk 1 or 3 for one save game file.

Some theories as to why someone thought there might be a save game on disk 2:

1. At least one distributed version of K240 has a _deleted_ partial save game
file `k240.1` on disk 2 which someone may have recovered. If you attempt to save
to disk 2, the game will write the first 15KB or so before running out of space
and deleting the partial file. Ejecting the disk while writing, or recovering
the deleted file somehow, would result in a partial save file that can be loaded
successfully to begin a new game. Testing suggests that loading such a partial
save will begin a new game with the default enemy, which may lend some
credibility to this theory. Additionally, the content of the partial save file
can influence the game to a limited extent. However, it's not a deliberately
hidden secret enemy as the cheat says, but rather a bug caused by loading a
partial save game file.
2. Someone deleted the HD installer from Disk 3 to make room for a single save
game. They then saved at the start of a game or before game to test it, and it
worked. Someone else then borrowed that disk or a copy of it, and played a round
of the game, during which the game requested Disk 3 to play the voice files.
With Disk 3 still inserted, the player then attempted to load a game, and was
surprised to find that it worked. They forgot that they had inserted Disk 3, and
mistakenly assumed that the save was on Disk 2.
3. The string `k240_2:k240.1` appears in the game executable, which may lead
a casual analyst to assume there must be a secret save game on disk 2. However,
this string is used to load games from a hard disk install, where `k240_2:` will
be assigned to the hard disk install rather than physical disk 2. Someone who
discovered the cheat strings in the game code may have also noticed this string
and made an incorrect deduction.
4. Disk 2 has a file called "idfile" which is not copied on a HD install, and
its presence is used by the game to determine whether to load save games from
DF0: or the hard disk. If you performed a manual HD install by copying the
files and setting up assigns in user-startup (entirely possible as the HD
installer was on disk 3 and may have gone unnoticed by some), the game will
still try to load saves from `DF0:`, which may somehow have confused a player
into thinking his save is loading from somewhere else.
