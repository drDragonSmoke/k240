### Cheat codes

A set of 11 cheat codes appears in the game code.

To enter a cheat, type it on the keyboard (not case sensitive), hitting the
Return key before and after the code. You can chain together multiple codes this
way.

Bjork
: Voice test. Hit A-U to test one of the 21 voice samples. There is a bug: it
doesn't validate for keys below A, so you get interesting results pressing a
number key: if you press 1, it asks for disk &Sigma;. Press space to exit.

ICBM
: Give 4 of each missile and 4 spy satellites to the currently selected
asteroid, whether it belongs to you, an alien, or nobody. Limited to 4 because
aliens are capped to 5 of each missile, so this way it's safe even if the alien
builds one right after you hit the cheat. Of course, aliens can't use spy
satellites as they have no satellite silo, and an empty asteroid full of
missiles will probably be cleared when you colonize it.

Iceman
: Freezes all asteroid movement. Use again to restore movement again.

Lemings
: Add 50 population to the current asteroid, regardless of who owns it.  Note
that the cheat code is deliberately  spelled with one M like this. The cheat
code entry method ignores multiples of a letter, so typing _lemmings_
or even _lemmmmminnnnggss_ will work fine.

Loadsadosh
: Give 100,000 credits. Around 0x1a7fa in the game executable _playk240_
(v1.886) you will see the number _000186a0_. Hex edit that to
_000f4240_. Now it will instead give 1 million. The cap is 9,999,999
(one less than 10 million).

NASA
: Create a ship at the current location. It has random hardpoints, like a ship
acquired via reinforcements. Such a ship will always have a weapon in its first
hardpoint to ensure it doesn't accidentally generate an unarmed ship. It will
also never generate a ship with a Static Inducer or Warp Generator.

Noises
: Sound test. Press A-W to test one of the in-game noises. Unlike the Bjork
cheat, this correctly validates its inputs.

Panel
: Extracts a useful set of buttons. The buttons don't show until the screen is
refreshed, but the easiest way to do this is to tap left and right to rotate the
asteroid and back.

Skyscraper
: The build time of all Terran buildings is reduced to one day. Doesn't affect
buildings already under construction.

Telescope
: You can see all asteroids on the field view without scouting for them first,
and view all asteroids without a spy satellite. However, in all other ways,
undiscovered asteroids still count as undiscovered. Missiles you fire at them
will disappear (peculiarly, the Tylarans are exempt from this). Scout ships will
still earn rewards for discovering asteroids.

Tracey
: Toggle voice on/off.

Widget
: Toggle which blueprints you own. This is a bother because even though you gain
every blueprint you didn't already have, you lose every blueprint you already
had, and they're usually good ones so you have to buy them back. Clicking on the
Sci-Tek button when you own every blueprint does nothing.

### Tricks

Set a hotkey to an enemy asteroid. Go to colony view of one of your own
asteroids, or an empty asteroid. Now hit the hotkey. You'll get an error
message, but for a second the game will let you see the enemy colony.

A scout ship gives its report when it returns to the asteroid it set out from,
but that doesn't have to be one of your colonies. You can speed up scout reports
by sending the scout to a closer unoccupied asteroid, then scouting from there.
You will get the report when it returns to the unoccupied asteroid.

Even better, if you do an ore survey at that asteroid, you will get it
immediately. In other words, send the scout ship first, then when it arrives,
order it to do the survey. It will "return" to the surveyed asteroid and give
you the report immediately.
