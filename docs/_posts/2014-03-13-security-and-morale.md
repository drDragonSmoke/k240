{:.right}

A colony requires one Security Centre for every 100 colonists after the first
50, i.e. none for 0-149 colonists, one for 150-249 colonists, and so on.

### Rising Unrest

Each day that a colony goes without sufficient Security Centres, it gains one
point of Unrest, to a maximum of 310 points. Higher levels of Unrest lead to
security events (see below).

After a security event, there is a random delay of 30 to 59 days before another
security event can occur at that asteroid.

A colony with enough Security Centres (one for every full 100 colonists after
the first 50) reduces its Unrest by one point per day.

For each resource (air, food, water) that is currently unmet by either
production or surplus, a colony gains 2 points of Unrest per day.

Building a Security Centre immediately reduces Unrest by 100. If Unrest is high
enough, it may be worth building two or even three Security Centres to zero your
Unrest immediately, since the 4,500 credit per building cost is cheaper than the
financial loss from a single security event.

### Unrest Levels

| Points   | Status                   |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 0-40     | ASTEROID SECURE.         |
| 41-99    | LOW MORALE.              |
| 100-199  | SOCIAL UNREST.           |
| 200-299  | MAJOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. |
| 300-310  | SECURITY ALERT!          |

### Asteroid Secure
No security breach events happen.

### Low Morale

Worker strike (50% chance)
: All mining, shipbuilding, and missile construction are reduced to 40% of
normal speed. Command Centre is also affected (probably only to build Orbital
Space Dock). (No other buildings require workers.) Strike lasts 10-29 days.

Theft (50% chance)
: 1,000 - 10,000 credits stolen. If there is not enough money in general fund to
cover the loss, the rest is taken from Building fund, Vehicle fund, etc, and so
on.

### Social Unrest

Theft (33% chance)
: 10,000 - 50,000 credits stolen.

Worker strike (33% chance)
: Workers strike for 30-99 days.

Desertion (33% chance)
: If there are at least 50 colonists, 5-14 disappear from the colony.

### Major Criminal Activity

Theft (25% chance)
: 50,000 - 100,000 credits stolen.

Desertion (25% chance)
: 10-29 colonists disappear.

Missile stolen (25% chance)
: All units of a random missile are deducted from silos. The missile is chosen
at random (any except Anti-Virus), but if none of the chosen type are available
it tries again with the next two missiles before giving up. Anti-Virus can
therefore be stolen if the thieves attempt to steal Vortex when there are no
Vortex. It may be useful to keep one of each cheap missile to guard against
theft of valuable missiles that follow in the list, e.g. keep one Scatter,
otherwise a failed Scatter theft attempt will lead you to lose Virus or Mega
instead.

Ship stolen (25% chance)
: One ship is lost. This will be an Assault Fighter if any are available,
otherwise a Scoutship. If no Assault Fighters or Scoutships are available, no
ship will be stolen.

### Security Alert!

Theft (20% chance)
: 100,000 - 500,000 credits stolen.

Desertion (20% chance)
: 10-29 colonists disappear.

Ship stolen (20% chance)
: Randomly lose one of the following ships, in order of preference: Assault
Fighter, Combat Eagle, Scoutship, Transporter.

Missile stolen (20% chance)
: Lose all units of a random missile.

Blueprint stolen! (20% chance)
: A random blueprint is deleted. Missing blueprints can be re-purchased as
normal from Sci-Tek, but the consequences can be disastrous in the meantime.
