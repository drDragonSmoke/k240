### Solved gameplay mysteries

This project has been able to answer the following long-standing questions. Most
topics are other pages on the site.

Why does K240 crash sometimes?
: An error in the fleet handling routines appears to be the culprit. The longer
the game goes on, the more likely this game will trigger. A bug-fixed version of
the game was released. Press "V" during a game; v1.886 has the bug, v2.000 is
fixed. The free authorized download from Gremlin World is unfortunately the old
version. See [bugs](../game-mechanics/bugs.html) and
[differences between versions](../history/version-differences.html).

What causes the message "Asteroid structure too weak"?
: A colony can only have a maximum of 100 buildings, regardless of building size
or asteroid size.

I suddenly won without doing anything. Why?
: The [Ax'Zilanth](../alien/3-ax-zilanths.html) have an asteroid teleporter
technology known as the Mass Displacement Podule. There's a chance they will
teleport directly into another asteroid and be destroyed. Other aliens may
plausibly be destroyed by normal asteroid collisions.

Are there any cheats for K240?
: There are exactly twelve [cheat codes](../game-mechanics/cheats.html). Other
cheats reported by some sources are either false (secret hard alien cheat) or
only applied to the demo version (fire alien missiles, or fire unlimited
missiles).

What triggers the bribe to improve ore shipments?
: It's completely random. Withholding ore makes no difference. See
[random events](../game-mechanics/random-events.html).

How many Medical Centres, Security Centres, do I need?
: You need one Medical Centre and Security Centre for every 100 full colonists
after the first 50. Security is critical
(see [security and morale](../game-mechanics/security-and-morale.html) for what
happens if you let unrest grow), and even after you build enough Security
Centres, unrest only subsides slowly.
Medical Centre is only needed to cure outbreaks, which only occur by
[random events](../game-mechanics/random-events.html).

How many Decontamination Filters do I need?
: Fewer than you might think. Although every Decontamination Filter reduces
radiation by 30%, every Medical Centre reduces the _effect_ of radiation by 10%.
Even then, you can reach 70% radiation before you start suffering a net
population loss on average.
See [health, radiation and population growth](../game-mechanics/health-radiation-and-population-growth.html).

Do Decontamination Filters permanently erase radiation?
: No. They sometimes appear to, because you can demolish a Decontamination
Filter and find radiation still at 0%. What actually happened is that you mined
the ores that are generating that radiation: 10% per 100 Asteros, per 2 Traxium,
and per 1 Nexos.

Why is my money going up when I haven't sold any ore?
: An important undocumented feature is that you gain 100 credits per day per
colony, and 2 credits per day per colonist. This is the primary benefit of
population, since workers are only required to operate mines and to build ships
or missiles. Even then only need 8 workers per relevant building and still
operate at 40% efficiency in a worker shortage.

What is the Kll-Kp-Qua "special type of warhead" mentioned in the manual?
: A missile which reduces the population of an asteroid by 20.

What does Last Minute Intelligence mean by "be careful when taking over an enemy
asteroid"?
: Asteroids which once belonged to the Ore Eaters explode when colonized. It is
unknown if this is intended to represent structural weakness from over-mining,
or some kind of boobytrap. It has the game effect of destroying asteroids which
the Ore Eaters been mined dry, which allows new asteroids to spawn in.

Do the aliens follow the same rules as the player?
: No. The rules vary considerably between individual aliens (see the alien pages
on the [index page](https://tetracorp.github.io/k240/). For example, some
actually mine ore, while others do not. They are not constrained by currency.

Are the upgraded turret blueprints worth it?
: Plasma Turret deals as much damage as 2&frac12; Laser Turrets. Photon Turret
deals as much damage as 4 Laser Turrets. They are 60/66% more power-efficient
than the Laser per point of damage, and become cost-effective per point of
damage at 20/17 turrets, accounting for the investment of the blueprint.
However, Laser with the Turret Optimiser is 100% more power-efficient and has
the advantage that it also doubles every turret on a Protected building. It's
not cost-effective, but it stacks very well with Photon Turret, where it deals 8
times the damage of base Laser and is 3.2 times more power-efficient.

How many Anti-Missile Pods should I build?
: One Anti-Missile Pod has a 21% chance to shoot down any given missile.
However, each additional Pod only adds 2% to the chance, to a maximum of 71%
with 26 Pods. Building 26 Anti-Missile Pods would cost 182,000 CR plus 78MW of
power generation (20 Solar Generators for 30,000 CR), plus the blueprint at
250,000 CR, so 462,000 CR in total. It might be wise to spend that money on
nuclear missiles to destroy the enemy before they fire.

Are there any errors in the game manual?
: A few, mostly in
[building behaviour](../game-mechanics/building-behaviour.html)
Powerplants produce 32MW/day while there is unmined Asteros, and no power when
it is depleted. Asteroid Engines use 2-7 power rather than 0-5. Ships in a
"hanger" are only only repaired if you have a Repair Facility.
The Photon Cannon is more powerful than the Plasma Cannon, as are the ship
hardpoint versions.
For features which are not documented in the manual, see... this entire site,
really.

The final game screen gives me a bonus of 5,000,000 credits. Do I actually get
to keep it?
: No. Internally, your money isn't acutally incremented in 5,000,000. Not that
it would make a difference, since your money doesn't carry over between
missions.
In [Dungeons of Avalon](https://tetracorp.github.io/dungeons-of-avalon/), you actually do get to
keep the 20,000 gold you get for winning.

### Still unknown

How does the alien AI function?
: Unknown. A few variables have been identified but their functions are not yet
understood.

What does Last Minute Intelligence mean by the "very predictable" pattern in the
Kll-Kp-Qua attacks?
: Unknown.

What damage does each missile and ship hardpoint do?
: The exact effect of fire-based weapons, Vortex, and some are yet to be
determined precisely.
