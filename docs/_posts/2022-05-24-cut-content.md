### Orbital Shuttle

A ship known as the Orbital Shuttle appears in the game data. The ship has
sprites, names, and game statistics, but it has no wireframe graphic for the
shipbuilding screen.

It is referred to by text string #126, which is the first of eight consecutive
strings of ship names. (Orbital Space Dock appears much later at string #173,
suggesting that was added later.) Despite not appearing in the game, its name is
translated.

- English: ORBITAL SHUTTLE
- French: VAISSEAU ORBITAL
- German: ORB.-TRANSPORTER

The Orbital Shuttle has an internal ID number of `1` (one before the Assault
Fighter, at `2`). It has following statistics:

- Armour: 10
- Speed: 2 FN. (equal to Scoutship)
- Hardpoints: 0
- Build time: 10 days
- Ore: 2 Selenium, 1 Crystalite
- Cost: 3,000 CD (equal to Scout Ship)
- Length: 13 m (equal to Assault Fighter)

Here's what it would look like if you could build it (note that it uses the
Assault Fighter wireframe):

It's a mystery what it was used for, since it has no weapons.

### Planned features

According to [an interview](https://amr.abime.net/review_20463)
with the game's programmer Graeme Ing in _The One Amiga_ #59 (Aug 1993), various
planned features were cut from the game for technical reasons and time limits.

Multiplayer
: _Populous_ (1989) featured null-modem multiplayer. For K240, however, the
amount of data necessary to transfer made this impractical. (_The One_ Aug 1993)

Scenario goals
: Originally, alien scenarios would have mission goals, which may be optional.
Examples given included destroying a shield generator, finding a certain
resource before the enemy does, (_The One_ Aug 1993) disabling convoys, and
locating bases ([_Amiga Action_ Sept 1993](https://amr.abime.net/review_25444))
In the final game, only the Swixarans have a mission goal, to destroy asteroid
cloak generators.

Research
: According to [_Amiga Power_ #30](https://amr.abime.net/review_19688)
(Oct 1993), K240 would allow the player to acquire technology by scientific
research. The final game would have players buying technology blueprints from
Sci-Tek instead. Sci-Tek was already part of the game design by the time of the
[CU Amiga Mar 1994](https://amr.abime.net/review_29004) interview.
