### Orbital Shuttle

A ship known as the Orbital Shuttle appears in the game data. The ship has
sprites, names, and game statistics, but it has no wireframe graphic for the
shipbuilding screen.

It is referred to by text string #126, which is the first of eight consecutive
strings of ship names. (Orbital Space Dock appears much later at string #173,
suggesting that was added later.) Despite not appearing in the game, its name is
translated.

- English: ORBITAL SHUTTLE
- French: VAISSEAU ORBITAL
- German: ORB.-TRANSPORTER

The Orbital Shuttle has an internal ID number of `1` (one before the Assault
Fighter, at `2`). It has following statistics:

- Armour: 10
- Speed: 2 FN. (equal to Scoutship)
- Hardpoints: 0
- Build time: 10 days
- Ore: 2 Selenium, 1 Crystalite
- Cost: 3,000 CD (equal to Scout Ship)
- Length: 13 m (equal to Assault Fighter)

Here's what it would look like if you could build it (note that it uses the
Assault Fighter wireframe):
