Here are a few minor undocumented features.

### Skip intro

Hold the left mouse button to skip the intro sequence.

This is mainly useful on the hard disk install. When playing from floppy disk,
you can skip the intro just by booting from disk 2.

### Hold Tetracorp slogans

In the new game / load game screen, a series of advertising slogans for
Tetracorp appear. If you hold a mouse button, the current slogan will stay on
screen until you let go.

### Land on hangar

If you order a ship to Land on Surface, and it chooses a square with a hangar in
it, it will land _in_ the hangar instead.

### Free temporary gravity nullifier

At the start of the game, for a limited time period, your colony and the enemy
colony is affected by a temporary Gravity Nullifier effect. This is hard to
notice, because it has normally worn off by the time you buy the blueprints that
let you see asteroid speed.

### Asteros half-life

Asteros depletes at the rate of one unit every four days. This starts from the
moment you colonize the asteroid.

### Ax'Zilanth viral resistance

When fighting against the Ax'Zilanth, the second missile you fire against an
asteroid has no effect. That alien appears to adapt after the first missile.
This applies even if you fire a second virus at yourself.
