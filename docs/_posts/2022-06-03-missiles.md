The exact effect and damage values of missiles are never stated in the game or
its manual. The following effects have been calculated by reading the game code
and testing.

The exact effect of fire-using weapons have not been fully explored in code due
to their complexity, although they have been analyzed by practical testing.

{:toc}

### Explosive

![explosive](../images/missiles/explosive.png "explosive")
{:.left}

The Explosive missile deals 10 damage to each of four contiguous squares. It may
strike fewer than four, e.g. if part of the area is covered by a rock or the
edge of the asteroid.

See [building hitpoints](../game-mechanics/building-hitpoints.html) and the
individual alien articles for how much damage each building can take before it's
destroyed. Most buildings have more than ten hitpoints, although they don't
normally regenerate damage without a Repair Facility, so damage is cumulative.

### Area Explosive

![area-explosive](../images/missiles/area-explosive.png "area-explosive")
{:.left}

The Area Explosive deals 10 damage, but over a larger area. In testing, it
strikes up to 24 squares in a fixed shape across the asteroid, approximately six
wide and four tall.

### Napalm

![napalm](../images/missiles/napalm.png "napalm")
{:.left}

Napalm strikes an area comparable to the Area Explosive, around 24 squares.

In testing, it deals 5 base damage on hit, followed by further damage from the
fire animation at 1 damage per hit. It appears to deal somewhere between 10 and
14 damage in total, based on the observation that one Napalm destroys a
Resiblock but not a Missile Silo. Program tracing suggests it may deal 5 damage
twice, plus 3 fire damage from the burn. However, it also appears that a single
Napalm is able to take out a 36 HP C.P.U. in one hit, so it must be dealing this
damage per-square rather than per-building.

Swixarans appear to have weakness to fire, taking more damage from Napalm. It
deals 8 base damage against them instead of 5. The increased damage also applies
if you fire Napalm against your own asteroid while Swixaran is the current
alien.

### Hellfire

![hellfire](../images/missiles/hellfire.png "hellfire")
{:.left}

Hits with fire which can spread. In testing, it actually has a smaller effective
area than Napalm, only around 10 squares. It appears to be able to spread to
adjacent buildings, but it still tends to have a smaller overall area than the
Napalm. More testing is required to determine if Hellfire really is weaker than
Napalm, although it is observed that a single Hellfire does not destroy a C.P.U.
as a Napalm does.

Like Napalm, Hellfire deals 8 base damage against Swixarans instead of 5.

### Nuclear

![nuclear](../images/missiles/nuclear.png "nuclear")
{:.left}

Nuclear missile deals 7 damage to every building on an asteroid and sets fire to
the entire asteroid. Fire-based weapons have not been fully analyzed, but it
appears to deal an additional 9 burn damage per square, for 16 total damage per
one-square building and 43 damage per four-square building. Without Screen
Generator or Building Armour, this will destroy every four-square Terran
including the C.P.U., which can instantly destroy an underdeveloped colony.

It has a 25% chance to destroy each ship in orbit. If the background radiation
level 70% or less, it increases background radiation by 70%.

The Rigellian version of the Nuclear deals 10 base damage instead of 7, and
only increases background radiation by 30%.

### Scatter

![scatter](../images/missiles/scatter.gif "scatter")
{:.left}

Strikes a random pattern of single squares. In testing, it appears to strike
around 15 squares, in a pattern well spread out across the asteroid, which are
typically non-contiguous. Deals 10 damage to each square hit.

The drawback to Scatter is that since it's spread out, it's less likely to hit
four-square buildings multiple times.

### Virus

![virus](../images/missiles/virus.gif "virus")
{:.left}

If Virus strikes a building, it immediately destroys the building. It spreads
green goo which destroys buildings and makes the terrain impossible to build on.

Ax'zilanths have the ability to adapt to Virus. Every Virus missile which hits
them after the first has no effect.

The Ore Eater version of Virus doesn't spread across the surface, but slowly
transforms the asteroid's ores into Selenium.

### Mega

![mega](../images/missiles/mega.png "mega")
{:.left}

Mega causes an asteroid to explode completely, as if by collision with another
asteroid.

### Stasis

![stasis](../images/missiles/stasis.gif "stasis")
{:.left}

Freezes the asteroid in stasis. It has a 30% chance to unfreeze on each of three
times per year, on days 32, 64, and 96. The following table shows the odds of
duration:

|Rolls| Years | Odds   | Cumulative |
|:----|:------|-------:|-----------:|
|  1  |  0.3  | 30.00% |     30.00% |
|  2  |  0.6  | 21.00% |     51.00% |
|  3  |  1.0  | 14.70% |     65.70% |
|  4  |  1.3  | 10.29% |     75.99% |
|  5  |  1.6  |  7.20% |     83.19% |
|  6  |  2.0  |  5.04% |     88.24% |
|  7  |  2.3  |  3.53% |     91.76% |
|  8  |  2.6  |  2.47% |     94.24% |
|  9  |  3.0  |  1.73% |     95.96% |
| 10  |  3.3  |  1.21% |     97.18% |

### Vortex

![vortex](../images/missiles/vortex.png "vortex")
{:.left}

Vortex spawns a wandering electrical storm. Each game tick, following happens:

| Chance | Event     |
|-------:|:----------|
|   1%   | Divide in two, effectively spawning a second Vortex storm. |
|   3%   | Disappear. |
|  48%   | Deal 2 damage to the building at the current location, or 5 damage if the current enemy is Rigellians. |
|  48%   | Move. |

The only alien which uses Vortex missile is the Ax'Zilanth, although the Ore
Eaters and Tylarans do have ships with Vortex Mines. This may be because each
Vortex storm counts toward the maximum of 700 ships, so heavy use of Vortex
by aliens would quickly fill those.

Vortex is especially effective against Rigellians, dealing 5 per hit instead of
2 per hit. This also applies if the player fires a Vortex at their own asteroid
while the current alien is Rigellian.

### Antivirus

![antivirus](../images/missiles/antivirus.gif "antivirus")
{:.left}

Antivirus turns all green virused squares into blue squares, which eventually
cure into normal squares. No aliens have Antivirus, making Virus quite powerful,
although the Ax'Zilanth are capable of adapting to it.

### Alien missiles

Aliens each have their own unique missiles, as well as using standard missiles:

| Vortex    |:x:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:x:|:x:|
| Antivirus |:x:|:x:|:x:|:x:|:x:|:x:|

In addition, each alien has their own unique missiles:

Kll-Kp-Qua
: One unique missile, which reduces the population by 20 and produces a blue
flash.

Ore Eaters
: Two unique missiles. The first deals 14 damage to every building. The second
destroys a single building if it hits one, then randomly gives the asteroid 100
to 299 additional ore of a common (red) type. Additionally, their Virus missile
is a variant which does not spread across the asteroid surface, but instead
converts other ores into Selenium at a rate of one unit per 5 days.

Ax'Zilanths
: Two unique missiles. One intercepts and neutralizes incoming warheads. The
other causes Static Inducer effect against all ships.

Tylarans
: They do not use missiles at all.

Rigellians
: Two unique missiles. One drains power, reducing the asteroid's power
generation by half for 20 to 39 days. The other is a bioweapon which kills 20
population and causes an immediate viral outbreak. Additionally, their Nuclear
is more powerful, dealing 10 base damage instead of 7.

Swixarans
: Three unique missiles. One is a bioweapon which kills 50 colonists. The second
dissolves all Sensor Array buildings on the asteroid. The third causes ongoing
sabotage to buildings, dealing 10 damage every 4 days to a random building, and
triggers 4-9 times.

See the individual alien pages for specific information on each alien's missiles
and the precedence of building each missile.
