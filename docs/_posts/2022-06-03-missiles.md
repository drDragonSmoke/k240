The exact effect and damage values of missiles are never stated in the game or
its manual. The following effects have been calculated by reading the game code
and testing.

1. Table of Contents
{:toc}

### Explosive

![explosive](../images/missiles/explosive.png "explosive")
{:.left}

The Explosive missile deals 10 damage to buildings in each of four contiguous
squares.

Internally, the game considers this a 2x2 square area. However, it maps onto the
asteroid's coordinate system in the shape of a Z-shaped or S-shaped Tetris
block.

Like all area effects, the missile can strike a four-square building multiple
times if it hits more than one of its squares. It may hit fewer than four
squares, if part of the area is covered by rocks or the edge of an asteroid.

The Explosive's 2x2 area in particular appears to only spread down and right
from the start point, meaning that one which strikes the very bottom-right of an
asteroid will affect only one square have nowhere to spread. Asteroid edges are
always marginally safer because there are fewer adjacent squares for missile
effects to spread from.

See [building hitpoints](../game-mechanics/building-hitpoints.html) and the
individual alien articles for how much damage each building can take before it's
destroyed. Most buildings have more than ten hitpoints, although they don't
normally regenerate damage without a Repair Facility, so damage is cumulative.

### Area Explosive

![area-explosive](../images/missiles/area-explosive.png "area-explosive")
{:.left}

The Area Explosive deals 10 damage, same as Explosive but over a larger area. It
strikes a 5x5 area, hitting 25 squares. Internally that's a 5x5 square, but in
practice that renders in a wide spread approximately six horizontally and four
vertically (in default asteroid rotation). Take that into account when firing
them, and when placing buildings, since all aliens except Tylarans use this
missile. Fire one at an asteroid to get a sense of its blast shape.

### Napalm

![napalm](../images/missiles/napalm.png "napalm")
{:.left}

Napalm strikes the same 5x5 area as the Area Explosive. Fire one at an asteroid
to get a good sense of what the game's 5x5 area looks like.

Napalm deals 5 damage on hit to each square. Fire continues to burn, dealing 1
point of damage 9 times, for a total of 14 damage.

Swixarans have weakness to fire, taking more damage from Napalm. It deals 8 base
damage against them instead of 5, and 2 damage per tick afterward, for a total
of 26. The increased damage also applies if you fire Napalm against your own
asteroid while Swixaran is the current alien.

### Hellfire

![hellfire](../images/missiles/hellfire.png "hellfire")
{:.left}

Initially, this is a _weaker_ version of Napalm: 3x3 area, 5 initial damage and
6 damage over time, for a total of 11 damage.

Its special ability is that its fire can spread. If it spreads to a new
building, that building takes the 5 initial damage, followed by the fire damage
over time. However, testing suggests that the Hellfire's ability to spread is
unreliable, and the missile may be overrated.

Like Napalm, Hellfire deals additional damage against Swixarans: 8 base damage,
and 2 fire damage per turn, for a total of 20.

### Nuclear

![nuclear](../images/missiles/nuclear.png "nuclear")
{:.left}

Nuclear missile deals 7 damage to each building on the asteroid. Four-square
buildings are only struck once each.

Every square occupied by a building is then set on fire, as Napalm, dealing 1
point of damage 9 times. This fire _does_ affect every square of a 4-square
building. In total, every one-square building takes 16 damage, and every
four-square building takes 43 damage. Without Screen Generator or Building
Armour, this is enough to destroy every four-square Terran building including
the C.P.U., which will instantly destroy an underdeveloped colony.

Nuclear also has a 25% chance to destroy each ship in orbit. If the background
radiation level is 70% or less, it increases background radiation by 70%.

The Rigellian version of the Nuclear deals 10 base damage instead of 7, and only
increases background radiation by 30%. It does not destroy ships in orbit.
These traits only apply to nukes fired by the Rigellians, not your own.

### Scatter

![scatter](../images/missiles/scatter.gif "scatter")
{:.left}

Strikes a random pattern of up to 25 squares, dealing 10 damage to each square
hit. The same square can be hit multiple times, and some hits will be wasted on
rocky squares.

The drawback to Scatter is that since it's spread out, it's less likely to hit
four-square buildings multiple times.

### Virus

![virus](../images/missiles/virus.gif "virus")
{:.left}

Strikes with a 3x3 square blast, instantly destroying any buildings in the area.
All flat ground tiles (2d, 2e, and 2f) become green goo, and unbuildable.

Once every six days, the green goo can spread, destroying any building it
touches.

Ax'zilanths have the ability to adapt to Virus. Every Virus missile which hits
them after the first has no effect.

The Ore Eater equivalent of Virus doesn't spread across the surface, but slowly
transforms the asteroid's ores into Selenium.

### Mega

![mega](../images/missiles/mega.png "mega")
{:.left}

Mega causes an asteroid to explode completely, as if by collision with another
asteroid.

### Stasis

![stasis](../images/missiles/stasis.gif "stasis")
{:.left}

Freezes the asteroid in stasis. It has a 30% chance to unfreeze on each of three
times per year, on days 32, 64, and 96. The following table shows the odds of
duration:

|Rolls| Years | Odds   | Cumulative |
|:----|:------|-------:|-----------:|
|  1  |  0.3  | 30.00% |     30.00% |
|  2  |  0.6  | 21.00% |     51.00% |
|  3  |  1.0  | 14.70% |     65.70% |
|  4  |  1.3  | 10.29% |     75.99% |
|  5  |  1.6  |  7.20% |     83.19% |
|  6  |  2.0  |  5.04% |     88.24% |
|  7  |  2.3  |  3.53% |     91.76% |
|  8  |  2.6  |  2.47% |     94.24% |
|  9  |  3.0  |  1.73% |     95.96% |
| 10  |  3.3  |  1.21% |     97.18% |

### Vortex

![vortex](../images/missiles/vortex.png "vortex")
{:.left}

Vortex spawns a wandering electrical storm. Each game tick, the vortex will do
the following:

| Chance | Event     |
|-------:|:----------|
|   1%   | Divide in two, effectively spawning a second Vortex storm. |
|   3%   | Disappear. |
|  48%   | Deal 2 damage to the building at the current location, or 5 damage if the current enemy is Rigellians. |
|  48%   | Move. |

The only alien which uses Vortex missile is the Ax'Zilanth, although the Ore
Eaters and Tylarans do have ships with Vortex Mines. This may be because each
Vortex storm counts toward the maximum of 700 ships, so heavy use of Vortex
by aliens would quickly fill those.

Vortex is especially effective against Rigellians, dealing 5 per hit instead of
2 per hit. This also applies if the player fires a Vortex at their own asteroid
while the current alien is Rigellian.

### Antivirus

![antivirus](../images/missiles/antivirus.gif "antivirus")
{:.left}

Antivirus turns all green virused squares into blue squares, which eventually
cure into normal squares. No aliens have Antivirus, making Virus quite powerful,
although the Ax'Zilanth are capable of adapting to it.

### Alien missiles

Aliens each have their own unique missiles, as well as using standard missiles:

| Missile   | Kll | Ore | Axz | Tyl | Rig | Swi |

| Antivirus |:x:|:x:|:x:|:x:|:x:|:x:|

In addition, each alien has their own unique missiles:

[Kll-Kp-Qua](../alien/1-kll-kp-qua.html)
: One unique missile, which reduces the population by 20 and produces a blue
flash.

[Ore Eaters](../alien/2-ore-eaters.html)
: Three unique missiles. The first deals 14 damage to every building. The second
destroys a single building if it hits one, then randomly gives the asteroid 100
to 299 additional ore of a common (red) type. (This can increase radiation if it
gives you Asteros.) The third converts ores other than Nexos into Selenium at a
rate of one unit per 6 days.

[Ax'Zilanths](../alien/3-ax-zilanths.html)
: Two unique missiles. One intercepts and neutralizes incoming warheads. The
other causes a Static Inducer effect against all ships.

[Tylarans](../alien/4-tylarans.html)
: They do not use missiles at all. An unusual quirk is that while using the
Telescope [cheat](../game-mechanics/cheats.html), you can hit Tylaran asteroids
with missiles before you've formally discovered them, which normally you can't.

[Rigellians](../alien/5-rigellians.html)
: Two unique missiles. One drains power, reducing the asteroid's power
generation by half for 20 to 39 days. The other is a bioweapon which kills 20
population and causes an immediate viral outbreak. Additionally, their Nuclear
is more powerful, dealing 10 base damage instead of 7.

[Swixarans](../alien/6-swixarans.html)
: Three unique missiles. One is a bioweapon which kills 50 colonists. The second
dissolves all Sensor Array buildings on the asteroid. The third causes ongoing
sabotage to buildings, dealing 10 damage every 4 days to a random building, and
triggers 4-9 times.

See the individual alien pages for specific information on each alien's missiles
and the precedence of building each missile.
