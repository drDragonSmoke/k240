### K240 copyright

_K240_ is copyright &copy;1994 Gremlin Graphics. All content from this game used
on this website remains the property of the copyright holder. Its use on this
website is believed to constitute fair use for the purposes of criticism and
analysis.

The disassembled executable presented here is insufficient to play the game, and
is only presented here to annotate its function. However, an authorized, legal
distribution of K240 is available at [Gremlin Graphics
World](http://gremlinworld.emuunlim.com/amiga.htm).

As far as I know, copyright to most Gremlin games is currently held by
Urbanscan, a company founded by original Gremlin founder [Ian
Stewart](https://twitter.com/ianstewart10), who bought the rights back from
Infogrames around the year 2000. This includes Utopia, and probably K240.
