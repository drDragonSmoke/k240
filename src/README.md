This directory currently contains two previous dissassemblies of K240.

### playk240_1.68k.asm

A partially-annotated disassembly of a cracked version of K240 v1.886.
Disassembled in Feb 2014 using ira 2.07, with edits as late as June 2014.
This is the first disassembly attempt.

### playk240_2.68k.asm

A second disassembly attempt. I intended to make a disassembly of K240 v2.000,
but accidentally used another another copy of v1.886. Oops. Disassembled with
ira v2.08 no later than Dec 2014, and worked on until June 2018. It included a
new custom variable format which used a python script to identify variable
types.
