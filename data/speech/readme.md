# Speech

These are unpacked from the speech MGL files which appear on disk 3. They appear
to be in raw audio format and play with a rate of around 13000.

Of special note is _enemyves_, an audio warning of an enemy vessel approaching,
which does not appear in the final game. It is even omitted from the in-game
_bjork_ sound test cheat, which instead includes _resource_ twice. It may have
been removed since individual enemy ships only travel as scouts and
transporters, and never actually approach the player's asteroids outside of
fleets.
