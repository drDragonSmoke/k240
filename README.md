# K240 disassembly project

This project analyzes the assembly language code for the Commodore Amiga game
K240 in order to understand how it works. The project's findings will be
gradually documented here: https://tetracorp.github.io/k240/

## Files

playk240.68k.asm is a heavily annotated disassembly of the main game
executable, version v1.886. It is full of useful raw information. The
other files are mainly extracted data, and tools which were useful in
extracting data.
